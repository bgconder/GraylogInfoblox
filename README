Welcome to my Graylog Infoblox repository!

If you are struggling with using syslog input for your Infoblox servers, I recommend using a Raw/Plaintext UDP input instead. I found that when I used syslog input, my syslog timestamps were 6 hours behind. I attempted to use pipelines to resolve the issue, but unfortunately, I was unsuccessful.

I hope my experience can help anyone else who may be encountering the same issue. It's important to note that my Infoblox servers are running on version 8.5.2.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of extractors that you can easily import into your Graylog instance. Additionally, I have included some dashboards that I believe will be useful for managing your Infoblox logs.
